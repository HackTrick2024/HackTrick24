    Note that: 
        1. Once you requested a riddle you cannot request it again per game. 
        2. Each riddle has a timeout if you didnot reply with your answer it will be considered as a wrong answer.
        3. You cannot request several riddles at a time, so requesting a new riddle without answering the old one
          will allow you to answer only the new riddle and you will have no access again to the old riddle.

    Note that:
    1. Not calling this fucntion will cost you in the scoring function
    2. Calling it without sending all the real messages will also affect your scoring fucntion

     In this function you should:
        1. Initialize the game as fox 
        2. Solve riddles 
        3. Make your own Strategy of sending the messages in the 3 channels
        4. Make your own Strategy of splitting the message into chunks
        5. Send the messages 
        6. End the Game
    Note that:
        1. You HAVE to start and end the game on your own. The time between the starting and ending the game is taken into the scoring function
        2. You can send in the 3 channels any combination of F(Fake),R(Real),E(Empty) under the conditions that
            2.a. At most one real message is sent
            2.b. You cannot send 3 E(Empty) messages, there should be atleast R(Real)/F(Fake)
